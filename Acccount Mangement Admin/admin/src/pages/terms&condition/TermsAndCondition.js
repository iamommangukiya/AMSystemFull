                <h2>Termination/Access Restriction </h2>
                <p>
                    Spot your next pets reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site/App and the related
                    services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is
                    governed by the laws of the State of Texas and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in
                    Texas in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any
                    jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section.{' '}
                </p>

                <p>
                    You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Spot your next
                    pets as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. Spot your next pets's performance of this agreement is subject to
                    existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Spot your next pets's right
                    to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or
                    information provided to or gathered by Spot your next pets with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is
                    determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty
                    disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
                    superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the
                    remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.{' '}
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and Spot your next
                    pets with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
                    electronic, oral or written, between the user and Spot your next pet with respect to the Site. A printed version of this
                    agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based
                    upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and
                    records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this agreement
                    and all related documents be written in English.{' '}
